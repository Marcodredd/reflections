What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The pros are you actually chose when to commit, and what to commit.
The cons are you may likely commit very small parts of code resulting in having very large files of commits
